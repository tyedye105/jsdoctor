#### By _**Marty Kovach**, 01/06/2017_


## Known issues





## Description

This web utilizes the BetterDoctor API to allow the user to enter in their affliction and get a list of medical professionals that might be able to help manage or cure what ails them.




## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone this repo: https://github.com/tyedye105/jsdoctor`
* Setup your .env file with your API key from BetterDoctor
* In the terminal run $ npm install
* In the terminal run $ bower install
* In the terminal run $ gulp serve


## Technologies Used

Doctor Lookup
Create a website where users may enter a medical issue (ie: “toothache”) into a form, submit it, and receive a list of doctors they may seek out to help with their medical issue.

Use the BetterDoctors API to retrieve this information. You will need to make an account and an API key. Do not use someone else’s API key. Each API key can be invoked for 1000 API calls per day, so avoid making excessive API calls (ie: accidental infinite loops) during development.

Creating API Keys

Visit the BetterDoctors API site and click “Get a free API key”.
Fill out the form, or authenticate with GitHub.
Your API key should be listed on the front page (ex: “a2c356ibgh44…..”) or under My Account > Applications.
Setup Instructions

Place your token in an .env file at the top level of your directory. (For grading purposes, name your API key variable exports.apiKey in .env. Keep spelling and capitalization identical, as it considerably speeds up the grading process.)
Include .env in .gitignore.
Use at least two JavaScript files: One to receive form input, another to make an API request and display results.
The following starter code will provide a response (logged to the console) containing 20 results from the Portland, OR area. Use it to build an object that can be pushed to an array that can later be returned.
exports.getDoctors = function(medicalIssue) {
  $.get('https://api.betterdoctor.com/2016-03-01/doctors?query='+ medicalIssue+'&location=45.5231%2C-122.6765%2C%205&user_location=45.5231%2C-122.6765&skip=0&limit=20&user_key=' + apiKey)
   .then(function(result) {
      console.log(result);
    })
   .fail(function(error){
      console.log("fail");
    });
};
This example assumes your API Key is stored in an apiKey variable, asx described in this lesson.
Notice the ?user_key= used with the API key after the username. You must include your personal access token with your request.
Additional Resources

Consult the BetterDoctor API documentation for further information. The documentation is extensive and allows you to experiment with different queries for your API calls before putting together your code.

Further Exploration
If you have completed all objectives with time to spare, consider adding additional features, such as:

Allow users to search by name and medical issue.
Update the UI if a doctor can't be found (this happens when you search by name and issue quite frequently.)
Add an additional API call to retrieve the list of specialities from the database before you query for a doctor, then return that list in a dropdown menu.
Add styling with SASS. Use a Gulp task to compile it.
Objectives
Your code will be reviewed for the following objectives:

Does the website work as expected?
Did you follow all setup instructions, including storing your API key in the variable exports.apiKey?
Does the app separate front-end and back-end functionalities into different JavaScript files?
Is exports used successfully in at least one JavaScript file?
Are dependencies managed with npm and Bower?
Does the app include a gulp-based asset pipeline with a development server? Does the asset pipeline include all tasks from the homework this week? (See below)
Code and Git documentation follow best practices (setup instructions in README, .gitignore file discluding unnecessary content from repo, detailed well-formatted commit messages, etc.)
Does the project demonstrate concepts covered this week? If prompted, are you able to discuss the flow of your code and the concepts behind it with an instructor using correct terminology?
Is the app in a presentable, portfolio-quality state?
Is required functionality in place by the Friday deadline?
Gulp Tasks Reference
For reference, the following Gulp tasks were used this week:

Concatenation, minification, and running the browserify package on your JavaScript.
Building and cleaning.
Running the development server with live reloading.
Running JSHint.
Automatically including Bower dependencies as vendor.min.js and vendor.css.
Submission
Submit your code to the Modern JS Apps code review on Epicenter by 5:00pm on Friday.

Visit Independent Projects and Code Reviews for details on how to submit, how feedback works and course completion requirements.
